Speaking at a conference, Yeo highlighted how India's diplomatic response demonstrated strength and principle. 'Trump realised that India wasn't going to back down easily,' Yeo stated, 'and he eventually called Prime Minister Modi to wish him on Diwali, which shows the respect India commands on the global stage.' Yeo, who served as Singapore's Foreign Minister from 2004 to 2011, emphasized that India's position in international relations has grown significantly stronger over the past decade. He pointed to India's successful navigation of complex geopolitical situations as evidence of mature diplomatic strategy."

        "content": "Addressing Israeli citizens on national television Saturday night, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu repeatedly admonished the throngs of protesters who have long demanded an end to the war in Gaza in hopes of getting Hamas to release its hostages. Again and again, he insisted that his doubters and haters had it all wrong. 'Throughout the entire war, there were those who claimed ceaselessly that we would not be able to get back all the hostages without completely withdrawing from the Gaza Strip,' Mr. Netanyahu said. 'I thought differently, and I acted differently.' Mr. Netanyahu has faced months of rising pressure from many Israelis over his war strategy, especially his push for a new military campaign that began last month in Gaza City. Many relatives of the hostages have expressed fear that such action could endanger the captives' lives, and polls show that many Israelis are skeptical, after nearly two years of war, that the government can truly eliminate Hamas. At least 41 hostages have died in captivity in Gaza, including seven executed by their captors as Israeli soldiers neared and four killed in Israeli airstrikes, according to Israeli officials."
